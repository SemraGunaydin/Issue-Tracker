# Issue Tracking App
A professional and functional issue tracking application developed using vanilla JavaScript (ES6), HTML5, and CSS3.

 # Project Overview
This project originated from a tutorial by CodingTheSmartWay, which served as the foundation.
The application has been enhanced and refactored to utilize ECMAScript 6 features and updated to leverage the latest version of Bootstrap for a modern design and improved functionality.

# Key Features
- Form Submission: Users can submit issues by providing a description, priority level, and assigned worker information.
- Unique Issue ID: Each issue is assigned a unique identifier upon creation.
- Dynamic Issue Management: Issues are rendered on the page with actionable options:
- Close: Marks the issue as resolved.
- Delete: Removes the issue permanently.
- Persistent Storage: Issues are saved and retrieved using localStorage, ensuring persistence across browser sessions.

# Tools and Technologies Used
- Chance.js: For generating random and unique issue IDs.
- Bootstrap 4: Provides responsive styling and layout.
